    https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_order
    There are several ways you can change the ordering of elements:

      Add the circles after the rectangles, rather than before.
      Use D3's insert operator to insert the rectangles before the circle.
      Create one svg:g element to hold the circles, and another for the rectangles.
      Use D3's sort operator to reorder the elements.
5. for original circles, should I simply turn off element?
6. Back button...
